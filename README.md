# TG Airview 
User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute project

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

This is my company's website to present to potential clients. It covers a general overwiew of three types of services that I provide, link to external company as referral and a bit about the company. All the projects are included in the social media links (YouTube channel, Instagram, Facebook and a bit about myself on LinkedIn)
 
## UX
 
As a client, I want to be able to provide a better/different view of what interests me so I can sell it easier/spot the issue faster/create memories for myself.

## Wireframes

1. Plan: https://github.com/geoeskel/UCFD-Milestone-Project/blob/master/wireframes/Plan.jpg?raw=true
2. Landing page: https://github.com/geoeskel/UCFD-Milestone-Project/blob/master/wireframes/Landing%20page.jpg?raw=true 
3. Layout: https://github.com/geoeskel/UCFD-Milestone-Project/blob/master/wireframes/Layout.jpg?raw=true

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

1. Navbar collapses when device screen sive <992px. 
2. Background video on landing page 
3. Bootstrap signup form
 

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.


### Features Left to Implement

1. Carousel of projects (nicely styled with CSS/JQuery/Boostrap)
2. Different language versions (German, Polish, French)
3. 

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS 
3. Bootstrap libraries (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
4. Bootstrap examples (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/examples/navbar-fixed/)
5. JQuery (https://jquery.com)


## Testing

I am trying to keep the website as simple as possible while still encouraging the potential client to subscribe and contact us. Working with a real estate agent we managed to design it in a way that he would be tempteed to ask us for a quote and more service details. 

I have tested the website content on various devices and browsers (IE, Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to see how it actually looks like (mobile-first approach) and making sure that all the features available on desktop are properly presented on smaller screens.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"

Subscribe for has been tested and is working properly (e-mail needs to have '@' sign) 

The rows in 'Services' section need some clear separation in <992px screen view. (not addressed yet!)

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/geoeskel/UCFD-Milestone-Project.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
